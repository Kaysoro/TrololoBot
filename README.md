# TrololoBOT 
*Because too many discord tokens are available.*

## This application...
* permits you to know about permissions vulnerability from guilds
* permits you to "spy" in a very limited way channel messages
* permits you to interact with users from channels
* does not permit you to do a raid
* does not permit you to spam channels
* does not permit you to destroy guilds by using powerful permissions potentially owned.
 
## Possible improvements
* Add a search field to filter guilds in the treeview
* Add pagination in the treeview to reduce memory consumption (for bots with > 1000 guilds)
